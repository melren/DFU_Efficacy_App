# DFU_Efficacy_App
Sample application for exploratory efficacy analysis

# About This App & Study Background
This app was created as part of my internship projects at Genentech for the exploration of (mostly) efficacy endpoints of a randomized phase Ib study. The indication for this study is Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) and the endpoints here are related to amount of ulcer healing (size) compared to baseline. 

Patients with diabetes have high blood sugar. This in turn leads to poor blood flow which causes numbness in the extremities. When injuries occur in this region, the numbness causes them to go unnoticed. Additionally, poor bloodflow slows the immune response and exacerbates the healing process.

# App functionality
This modified version of the app is only intended to be a sample to showcase the types of visualizations implemented in the project.
  * The original data depends on snapshot data from the official study database. 
  * Due to confidentiality agreements, all data displayed in this app are randomly generated.
If errors for the plots appear, please open the Filter/Plot Options panel to refresh the input.
  * This is due to different types of plots requiring different parameters
  * When the panel is closed, previously unset variables are treated as NULL
  * If the download plot button is not working, the plots can be downloaded from the right-click menu
